# Developing for Platypie  
  
So you're interested in contributing to the Platypie codebase.. We think that's wonderful! Discussion of development happens on [IRC](http://kernelmeltdown.org/blog/how-to-set-up-irc-using-hexchat-beginners-walkthrough/). Jump on [Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23platypie "freenode's webchat") in #platypie  
We do our best to ensure that those who want to help are made welcome. In the interest of keeping everybody happy, we want to produce easily maintainable code. That means keeping everything readable, and using algorithms whose nature and purpose is transparent to people other than technological wizards.  
  
Read [Mozilla's guide to Rust style](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-style-guide) before starting. If your code isn't up to this standard, it won't be accepted. With that being said, we are happy to help you improve as a [FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Rust developer. There's no need to feel bad if your revision isn't accepted the first time around, it's a young language and we're fairly new to it ourselves.  
  
Code formatting is fairly simple to fix. Codebase issues are significantly more complicated. If your code requires additional dependencies, we hope you'll discuss it with us before jumping in. We don't want you to spend your time developing a solution only to have it turned down because of portability issues. If it comes down to it, though, portability **will** supercede your emotions. Stop by the official IRC channel and ask someone who has been *voiced*.
