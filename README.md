# What is <a href="http://platypie.org">Platypie</a>?
Platypie is an [open source](https://github.com/platypie "our git"), and truly crossplatform mesh networking initiative inspired by **[the world's favourite monotreme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus)**, the Platypus!  
  
Just like our semi-aquatic mascot, mesh networking software needs to evolve to be able to go *anywhere*. It must be compact enough to run on mobile devices, yet powerful enough to scale up in more 
demanding circumstances. Furthermore, it must be able to withstand determined aggressors. You probably think the platypus is adorable, and so do we. Many people do not realize that this wee mammal
also packs a venomous stinger which [can leave would be attackers in agony for months on end](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus_venom "platypus venom").  
<br>
We believe not only in tough cryptographic standards, but in providing a network architecture that cannot be compromised.  
  
Platypie is being developed in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/ "Rust Lang"), a modern, multi-paradigm programming language that we think is perfect for solving the issues of the modern web. Being web developers, we are also fond of [Javascript](http://nodejs.org/ "nodejs"). If you're interested in contributing, learning either would be a good place to start. Fixing the web is not just a technical problem, it is also very much a social problem. If you are skilled in graphic design, communication, or network hardware configuration, by all means, [get involved](https://github.com/platypie/platypie#get-involved)!  
  
The value of networking software is a product of its adoption. Although it's critical that a project like this produce working code, we are committed to first creating a viable set of specifications which will allow others to create alternatives which are interoperable with other nodes in the network. Skeptical? Western naturalists thought the platypus was a hoax when they first heard of it too!  
  
## Install it  
  
On unix based systems with git already installed:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/platypie/platypie.git  
cd platypie  
make nightly-install  
```
  
## Run it  
`make run`  
  
## Get involved  
Join us on [Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23platypie "freenode's webchat") in #platypie  
  
If you can program, and intend to submit code to be included in the official repository, start by first reading HACKING.md on our coding practices.  
  
If you don't program, or if you think this is over your head, we still need:  
* artwork
* documentation
* testing on various architectures/systems
* third party applications
* input (perhaps most importantly)
