# What is <a href="http://platypie.org">Platypie</a>?
Platypie is an [open source](https://github.com/platypie "our git"), and truly crossplatform mesh networking initiative inspired by **[the world's favourite monotreme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus)**, the Platypus!  
  
Just like our semi-aquatic mascot, mesh networking software needs to evolve to be able to go *anywhere*. It must be compact enough to run on mobile devices, yet powerful enough to scale up in more 
demanding circumstances. Furthermore, it must be able to withstand determined aggressors. You probably think the platypus is adorable, and so do we. Many people do not realize that this wee mammal
also packs a venomous stinger which can leave would be attackers in agony for months on end.  
<br>
We believe not only in tough cryptographic standards, but in providing a network architecture that cannot be compromised.
